## 📋 Standard

LENEX is an UTF-8 encoded XML file that is used as an exchange file for European swim meetings. LENEX files can occur in uncompressed way as `.lef` files as well as the compressed `.lxf` archive. Since March 2010 the current standard 3.0 exists and is valid. LENEX stands for "Ligue Européenne de Natation Exchange Format". The Specifications regarding LENEX can be found [🔗 here](https://wiki.swimrankings.net/index.php/swimrankings:Lenex).

## 🏊‍♀️ SwimResults

During the development and improvement of [SwimResults](https://swimresults.de) we needed to parse LENEX files. In this repository a LENEX file parser is developed independently from SwimResults.
