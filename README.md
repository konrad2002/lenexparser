This go package contains a parser for the [LENEX file format](https://www.wikiwand.com/de/Lenex) which is used as exchange format for swim meetings in Europe. The parser will support the current version 3.0 of the LENEX standard.

## 📋 Standard

LENEX is an UTF-8 encoded XML file that is used as an exchange file for European swim meetings. LENEX files can occur in uncompressed way as `.lef` files as well as the compressed `.lxf` archive. Since March 2010 the current standard 3.0 exists and is valid. LENEX stands for "Ligue Européenne de Natation Exchange Format". The Specifications regarding LENEX can be found [🔗 here](https://wiki.swimrankings.net/index.php/swimrankings:Lenex).

### Data Types

Lenex has a list of used data types. These are converted to the following Go data types:
